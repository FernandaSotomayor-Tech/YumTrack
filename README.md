# YumTrack
🥗 YumTrack - Meal Tracker App
A functional and interactive meal tracking application built with Vanilla JavaScript, focused on efficient DOM manipulation and clean data logic.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Structured semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic, dynamic UI updates, and data management without external libraries.

Vanilla CSS: Custom layout design using modern properties for a clean aesthetic.

🧠 Key Learnings
DOM Manipulation: Mastered selecting, creating, and updating HTML elements dynamically based on user input.

Event Handling: Implemented robust event listeners to capture and process user actions in real-time.

Data Persistence (LocalStorage): Learned how to save and retrieve data from the browser to keep logs after a refresh.

Clean Logic: Structured the code using functions to separate data processing from visual updates.

🚀 Challenges & Solutions
Dynamic List Management:

Challenge: Efficiently rendering new items and removing them without reloading the page.

Solution: Created a modular "render" function that synchronizes the JavaScript data array with the HTML view.

Form Validation:

Challenge: Preventing empty or invalid entries from being added to the tracker.

Solution: Integrated logic to validate inputs and provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

State Syncing:

Challenge: Keeping the total calorie/meal count accurate as items are added or deleted.

Solution: Implemented global counters that update automatically with every modification to the data set.
