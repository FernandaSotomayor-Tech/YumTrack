# YumTrack
🥗 YumTrack - Meal Tracker App

1) Context

YumTrack is a lightweight nutrition tracking web app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (Vanilla stack).

It simulates a simple product lookup tool where users can search foods, view nutritional information, and save favorites — similar to a minimal health companion app.

Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate DOM manipulation, state persistence, and structured UI logic without frameworks.

2) Problem

Many simple tracking tools lack:

Instant search feedback

Clear nutritional breakdown

Persistent user preferences

Structured UI state management

The challenge was to create a small but well-structured app that behaves predictably and feels interactive — without relying on libraries or frameworks.

3) Solution

Real-time filtering based on user input

Dynamic DOM rendering for product cards

Detail view toggle without page reload

Favorites system powered by localStorage

Responsive grid layout for product display

Clear separation between search, detail, and favorites views

The logic was written to simulate basic state management using pure JavaScript.

4) Result

Instant search experience

Persistent favorites across sessions

Clear UI transitions between views

Clean, modular code structure

A small-scale project that demonstrates understanding of core front-end fundamentals before introducing frameworks.

5) Tech Stack

JavaScript (Vanilla)

HTML5

CSS3 (Grid & Responsive Design)

Browser localStorage API

Built to reinforce strong fundamentals in DOM manipulation, UI state control, and client-side persistence.
